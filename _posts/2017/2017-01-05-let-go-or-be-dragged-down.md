title: Let Go or be Dragged Down
---
I knew all along there would be rivers of tears  
why didn't I just turn and run?  
A foolish notion that it could have been us  
well, I am just a simpleton.  

I should've known better than to fall in love  
with someone I can never have.  
I hope this time will be a lesson learned.  

Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  
Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  

Misunderstanding is my middle name  
as you have seen, you know me now.  
I've lost my dignity, I've lost my face  
it doesn't matter anyhow.  

I should've known better than to dream that I  
could steal you from another man.  
I hope this time my ego starts to learn.  

Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  
Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  

Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  
Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  

Let go or be dragged down. Let go.  
Let go or be dragged down. Let go.

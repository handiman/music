It's 4 AM  
I'm wide awake  
Trying to sort out all my mistakes  

My doctor says I shouldn't ruminate  
It is fatal to my mental state  
But I can't stop  

(You're a romantic fool)  
Yes, I know  
(You always lose your cool)  
Yes, I know  
(She's had enough of you)  
Don't say so  
(Why can't you just leave her be?)  
You tell me  

It's 5 AM  
Still wide awake  
Soon time to rise  
Make more mistakes  

My doctor says I shouldn't ruminate  
It is fatal to my mental state  
But it won't stop  

(You are a jealous fool)  
Yes, I know  
(You always lose your cool)  
Yes, I know  
(She's had enough of you)  
Yes, I know  
(There's no one who likes you)  
Yes, I know  
(You really messed up good)  
Yes, I know  
(Why don't you tie a noose?)  
Yes, I know  
(Why can't you just leave her be?)  
You tell me

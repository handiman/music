Why do they all stare?  
Get me out of here  
This is a nightmare  
Got to have more beer  

Should I buckle down  
or run for the hills?  
I put my clown face on  
Bloody useless pills  

Everything changes yet stays the same  
Different faces but the same old shame  
What's wrong with me?  
What's wrong with me?  

Totally at ease  
There's nothing to fear  
This will be a breeze  
Just bring me more beer  

The only way to stand  
Parties of this kind  
Always beer in hand  
Pissed out of my mind  

Everything changes yet stays the same  
Different places but the same old shame  
What's wrong with me?  
What the hell is wrong with me?  

Calling a cab I'm getting out of here  
Just gotta get my ass out of here  
I'm just such a waste of space  
Never gonna bother anyone again  

I gotta get out I gotta get away  
What's wrong with me?  
What's wrong with me?  
What the hell is wrong with me?

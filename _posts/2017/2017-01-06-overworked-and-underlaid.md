title: Overworked and Underlaid
---
You cannot tell me  
not to complain  
You don't know what it's like  
You cannot feel my pain  

I've lost all meaning  
I've had enough  
You brought me to my knees and  
I cannot get up  

Why I keep hanging on  
though I'm about to crack  
is such a mystery  
I'm overworked and underlaid.  
You won't see me again  
I'm never coming back  
You are no good for me  
I'm overworked and underlaid.  

Another work day  
I cannot stand  
I've had enough of all this  
"working for the man"  

Why I keep hanging on  
though I'm about to crack  
is such a mystery  
I'm overworked and underlaid.  
You won't see me again  
I'm never coming back  
You are no good for me  
I'm overworked and underlaid.

title: Forgive Me
---
You didn't see me today  
They must have told you I was sick  
But I was simply too ashamed  
Couldn't face the music  

I've been falling apart  
I am sorry for my mistake  
but another stab in my broken heart  
was just more than I could take  

I'm sure I will be alright  
I've been down like this before  
and I don't want to die  
I just don't want to live anymore  

I thought that I would be over you by now  
but I'm still the same love sick fool deep inside  
so I ruined our friendship with my jealosy,  
with my gnawing doubts and my insecurity  

I had no right to say the things I said  
if you want nothing to do with me I understand  
I swear I never wanted to cause you any pain  
and I swear I'll do my homework so it won't happen again  

Can you forgive me?  
Can you forgive me?

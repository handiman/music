title: Painfully Intense Attraction
---
Painfully intense attraction in every sense  
Desire can be such a beast  
Roller coaster ride of emotions running wild  
There's hasn't been a dull day at least  

I know there is no chance of starting a romance  
I should have kept my big mouth shut  
I was childish and naive and stupid to believe  
No wonder you thought I was a nut  

They're only fantasies but in my daily reveries  
If I find a way to live with this pain  
and do the best I can to be a better man  
it will turn out not to have been in vain

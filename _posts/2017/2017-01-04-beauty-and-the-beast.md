Please, if you have some time.  
I've poured my heart into these lines.  
All of these songs I wrote for you.  
I meant no harm I just had to.  

It's like you found a part of me  
That I had hidden away  
It's pining for affection  
It wants to come out and play  

I love to gaze into your eyes.  
You're beautiful, I love your smile.  
I love to hear you laugh, love to talk with you.  
I love to be with you, love to walk with you.  

But I must try to keep myself in place.  
If I crave too much I'll push you away.  
I have to let you be, give you some space.  
While life laughs me straight in the face.  

2x  
I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to hurt anymore  
I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to hurt anyone  

(Bridge)  

4x  
I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to hurt anymore  
I don't want to be a freak, I don't want to hurt anyone

I didn't know what passion's like  
until you came into my life  
and turned my world upon its head.  
You stirred up all the butterflies.  
You were like all my dreams come true  
and everything made sense.  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
to hold you once again.  


Why all this space between us now?  
You don't seem to want me around.  
I thought that we had something good?  
I'm sorry I misunderstood  
those sweet and tender words you spoke.  
Were they some kind of joke?  
Why you would want to hurt me so  
I guess I'll never know.  


I work so hard on getting free  
of all this muck inside of me.  
I'm so ashamed you had to see  
my ugliness, my jealosy.  
Someday I will get over this  
and find another muse.  
Until I find out who she is  
I write my songs for you.

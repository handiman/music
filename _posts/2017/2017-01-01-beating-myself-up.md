title: Beating Myself Up
---
Pain is all I know and I can't seem to let it go. Whatever happened to the good thing we had?  
What's the point of opening your heart to someone if it only means that you will push them away?  
Trying to convince myself it's not for real but just some stupid automatic thought in my head.  
Want to cry my heart out but there's no one to console me so I try my best to keep a straight face.  

Cannot let my guard down cannot let them see the real me because no one loves me when I'm weak.  
Send me to the nearest institution lock me up and make sure no one ever finds the key.  
Only ever wanted to be someone's special someone but I know that I can never be.  
I'm stupid, I'm a loser, I am foolish, I'm a fuckup, I'm a failure and I am a freak.

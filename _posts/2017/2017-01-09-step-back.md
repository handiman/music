title: Step Back
---
Get up, get in line  
Zombie walk from 9-5  
Too numb or too dumb  
to realize what you sacrifice  
Maybe it's time to shift into a lower gear?  
You only get this chance so you'd better start to live while you're here  

Step back, get out of this rat race  
Do I need to tell you it's living hell  
Step back, take a moment and ask yourself  
Do I need more cheese? Do I like the smell?  

Always testy? Always uptight?  
Feel like something is breaking inside?  
Always edgy? Sleepless nights?  
Nagging feeling you're wasting your life?  
Maybe it's time to shift into a lower gear?  
You only get this chance so you'd better start to live while you're here  

Step back, get out of this rat race  
Do I need to tell you it's living hell  
Step back, take a moment and ask yourself  
Do I need more cheese? Do I like the smell?  

Step back, get out of this rat race  
Life's too short to waste inside an office space  
Step back take a moment to watch the sky,  
smell the flowers and come alive  

Step back, get out of this rat race  
I don't need to tell you it's living hell  
Step back, take a moment and ask yourself  
Do I need more cheese? Do I like the smell?  

Not me.

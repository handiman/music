title: All Your Charms
---
Put your face close to mine  
let me gaze into your eyes  
you make me feel so fine  
I will tell you no lies  

I want to wake up  
with you in my arms  
I want to see you without makeup  
with all your charms  

Addicted to you  
you are forbidden fruit  
but I'm picturing you  
in your birthday suit  

Wanna be your lover  
Wanna please you all night  
Wanna kiss you all over  
until the morning light  

Press your lips close to mine  
let me find out how you taste  
on cloud nine  
holding you in my embrace  

I want to wake up  
with you in my arms  
I want to see you without makeup  
with all your charms  

Addicted to you  
you are forbidden fruit  
but I'm picturing you  
in your birthday suit  

Want to go exploring?  
let's see what we find  
you send my heart soaring  
let us spend some time  

I want to wake up  
with you in my arms  
I want to see you without makeup  
with all your charms  

I want to wake up  
with you in my arms  
I want to see you without makeup  
with all your charms

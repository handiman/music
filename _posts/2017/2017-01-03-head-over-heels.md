title: Head Over Heels
---
Where have you been all my life?  
Didn't know I could feel so nice.  
Help me 'cause I think I'm falling head over heels for you.  

It's a pity you're someone's wife.  
It's the story of my whole life.  
Please, forgive me, I think I've fallen head over heels for you.  

Didn't know I could feel this blue.  
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.  
Cannot help myself, cannot make myself fall out of love with you.  

Fair enough I can wait for you.  
Don't have anything else to do.  
Get to know me and you will see I would qualify as Plan B  

I'm not gonna be a hypocrite  
Not gonna lie, I must admit  
If your marriage turns to shit I would like to be your Plan B  

Cannot help myself, cannot make myself fall out of love with you.  
Please, forgive me, I think I've fallen head over heels for you.

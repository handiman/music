title: It's Alright
---
Would be cool to hang out  
Promise you I won't bite  
I don't know, perhaps we're simply too unalike  
Wish I'd had a chance to learn what you taste like  
But it's alright  
It's alright  

Call me up when you can   
Let's hook up or pretend  
Baby, you're the epitome of sex appeal  
Such a shame I never got to make you squeal  
But it's alright  
It's alright

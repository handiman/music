title: You'll Never Come Around
---
So this is how it's gonna be  
This is the last you'll see of me  
I will be off your back, but hey  
It's what you wanted anyway  

You'll never come around  
And I still feel like shit  
So low and broken down  
All I can do is split  

Go ahead and add me as a friend  
Facebook is good for playing pretend  
I'll never hear from you again  
All good things must come to an end  

You'll never come around  
And I still feel like shit  
So low and broken down  
All I can do is split  

You'll never come around  
And I still feel like shit  
So low and broken down  
All I can do is split
